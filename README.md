# he-dropper
Very basic hive-engine to hive-engine dropper

needs beem and hiveengine from pip3
install steemengine and do a slight tweak to get it to work with steem-engine tokens too

This is very basic, and does not include state saving in case of node disconnect
freely use at your own risk!


Edit the settings section directly in dropper.py before running!
